Given a series of x and y coordinates, connecting them sequentially
form a line consisting of multiple straight line segments. Design a
class that stores that line and performs a few operations on that line.
The class should have no additional function (except the
constructor) to set/get/take input of the private variables. The
one and only member function of the class calculate_length()
returns the total length of the line.
The skeleton of the class should be something like this:
class Line {
no of points constructing that line (integer value)
x and y coordinates of those points (real values)
public:
necessary constructors
calculate_length();
};
Take 2 objects of the class Line. With necessary inputs compare the 2
lines and output which line is bigger of the two. After that add some
points to those lines. Then compare again to see which line is bigger
of the two. See sample input output for clarification.
Sample Input
Number of points in Line 1: 3
Enter coordinates: 1 1
2 2
3 4
Number of points in Line 2: 2
Enter coordinates: 0 0
5.2 5.6

Add points in Line 1: 2
Enter coordinates: 7 8
0 0
Add points in Line 2: 0

Sample Output
Length of Line 1: 3.65028
Length of Line 2: 7.64199
Line 2 > Line 1
Updated Length of Line 1: 19.9373
Updated Length of Line 2: 7.64199
Line 1 > Line 2
